  "draft_report": "Sequence indicates probable unauthorized entry: front door opened while armed, rapid motion, and a glass-impact-like impulse. Smart lock logs show failed attempts then manual override. Camera blackout and router deauth storm suggest deliberate wireless disruption. Alarm was activated but silenced almost immediately with a valid keypad code, followed by creation of a new code under the admin account, indicating compromised credentials or insider access. Garage door activity aligns with a plausible departure route.",
  "consistency_check": "The immediate siren silence via keypad conflicts with the resident claiming they were asleep and unaware; either the keypad code was known to the intruder, or an authorized party interacted with the system. The east window open/close could be a secondary entry attempt or sensor glitch; timing is consistent with movement through that area but less supported than door/lock evidence.",
  "final_report": "Most likely scenario: an intruder gained access near 02:11 via the front door (or forced lock override), disrupted Wi‑Fi to reduce camera reliability, triggered the alarm, and then silenced it using a valid keypad code. The subsequent addition of a new keypad code under the admin account strongly suggests account compromise or insider activity. Garage door open/close shortly afterward is consistent with exit and vehicle access. Recommended next steps: audit admin account access, rotate all keypad codes, review camera footage around blackout, and inspect lock/door for tamper evidence."
